Write seven paragraphs of the CV of Kartika Lama, who grew up in the mountains of Peru and walked to school every day through the magestic mountains. Later went to the coast to study biology and fell in love with the ocean. Having alway had a strong skill for spitting contests it financed it's college years by paricipating and winning many contests, even national ones.
Later it dicovered the power of cactus meditation and wanted to study the brain to understand how it unfolds at a cellular and molecular level.

**Kartika Lama** was born and raised in the majestic mountains of Peru. The daily journey to school, traversing through the awe-inspiring landscapes, instilled in Kartika a deep appreciation for nature and a sense of resilience. This early exposure to the wonders of the natural world would later shape Kartika's academic and personal pursuits.

After completing high school, Kartika moved to the coast to study Biology. The transition from the mountains to the coast was transformative. Kartika fell in love with the vast, serene expanse of the ocean, and this newfound passion further fueled the desire to understand the intricate workings of life.

During the college years, Kartika discovered an unusual talent - a knack for spitting contests. What started as a fun pastime soon turned into a skill that would finance Kartika's college education. Kartika participated in numerous contests, consistently outperforming competitors, and even clinched victories in national championships.

The spitting contests did more than just pay for college; they taught Kartika the value of perseverance, precision, and the thrill of competition. These experiences enriched Kartika's college life, providing a unique balance to the rigors of academic study.

In the midst of these diverse experiences, Kartika stumbled upon the practice of cactus meditation. This unconventional form of meditation, focusing on the resilience and tranquility of cacti, brought a sense of peace and balance to Kartika's life. It sparked a curiosity about the power of the mind and the mysteries of consciousness.

This curiosity led Kartika to the field of Neurobiology. Fascinated by the complexity of the brain and its impact on human behavior and cognition, Kartika decided to delve deeper. The aim was to understand how the mind unfolds at a cellular and molecular level, and how practices like cactus meditation can influence this process.

Today, Kartika Lama stands at the intersection of Biology and Neurobiology, backed by a rich tapestry of unique experiences. From the mountains of Peru to the spitting contests, from the love for the ocean to the practice of cactus meditation, each chapter of Kartika's journey contributes to a holistic understanding of life and the human mind. Kartika continues to explore these fascinating realms, driven by a relentless curiosity and a desire to unravel the mysteries of the brain.

javascript, remove all children of the element ul[data-dyndrop], create new children from the array themes.
themes = [
  "cerulean",
  "cosmo",
  "cyborg",
  "darkly",
  "flatly",
  "journal",
  "litera",
  "lumen",
  "lux",
  "materia",
  "minty",
  "morph",
  "pulse",
  "quartz",
  "sandstone",
  "simplex",
  "sketchy",
  "slate",
  "solar",
  "spacelab",
  "superhero",
  "united",
  "vapor",
  "yeti",
  "zephyr",
];
in this format:
```html
<ul class="dropdown-menu" data-dyndrop="js">
  <li><a class="dropdown-item" data-switch="cerulean" href="#">Cerulean</a></li>
  <li><a class="dropdown-item" data-switch="cosmo" href="#">Cosmo</a></li>
  ...
  <li><a class="dropdown-item" data-switch="zephyr" href="#">Zephyr/a></li>
</ul>
```
add an click event listener to each a[data-switch] element that will trigger the function themeSwitch

---

Sure, here is a JavaScript code snippet that does what you asked for:

```javascript
// themes array
var themes = [
  "cerulean",
  "cosmo",
  "cyborg",
  "darkly",
  "flatly",
  "journal",
  "litera",
  "lumen",
  "lux",
  "materia",
  "minty",
  "morph",
  "pulse",
  "quartz",
  "sandstone",
  "simplex",
  "sketchy",
  "slate",
  "solar",
  "spacelab",
  "superhero",
  "united",
  "vapor",
  "yeti",
  "zephyr",
];

// get the ul element
var ulElement = document.querySelector('ul[data-dyndrop]');

// remove all children of the ul element
while (ulElement.firstChild) {
  ulElement.removeChild(ulElement.firstChild);
}

// create new children from the themes array
themes.forEach(function(theme) {
  var liElement = document.createElement('li');
  var aElement = document.createElement('a');
  aElement.className = 'dropdown-item';
  aElement.dataset.switch = theme;
  aElement.href = '#';
  aElement.textContent = theme.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + theme.slice(1);
  liElement.appendChild(aElement);
  ulElement.appendChild(liElement);

  // add click event listener to each a[data-switch] element
  aElement.addEventListener('click', themeSwitch);
});

// themeSwitch function
function themeSwitch(event) {
  // your code here
}

```

This code first removes all children of the `ul` element with `data-dyndrop` attribute. Then it creates new `li` and `a` elements for each theme in the `themes` array and appends them to the `ul` element. It also adds a click event listener to each `a` element that triggers the `themeSwitch` function. You need to replace `// your code here` with the actual implementation of the `themeSwitch` function.

write the themeSwitch function to replace the href of the link[data-theme] element:
  <link data-theme="" href="./bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
the replacement should be e.g. <link data-theme="" href="./bootswatch/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> when the anchor with data-switch="cerulean" was clicked - then provide a second, refactored script that stores the current href value  of  link[data-theme] in a session storage and upon page load checks the variable and replaces the <link data-theme="" href="./bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> with the respective href="./bootswatch/.../bootstrap.min.css" in the  link[data-theme] element

---

Sure, here is the `themeSwitch` function and the refactored script:


```javascript
// themeSwitch function
function themeSwitch(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  var theme = event.target.dataset.switch;
  var linkElement = document.querySelector('link[data-theme]');
  linkElement.href = './bootswatch/' + theme + '/bootstrap.min.css';
  sessionStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
}

// get the ul element
var ulElement = document.querySelector('ul[data-dyndrop]');

// remove all children of the ul element
while (ulElement.firstChild) {
  ulElement.removeChild(ulElement.firstChild);
}

// create new children from the themes array
themes.forEach(function(theme) {
  var liElement = document.createElement('li');
  var aElement = document.createElement('a');
  aElement.className = 'dropdown-item';
  aElement.dataset.switch = theme;
  aElement.href = '#';
  aElement.textContent = theme.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + theme.slice(1);
  liElement.appendChild(aElement);
  ulElement.appendChild(liElement);

  // add click event listener to each a[data-switch] element
  aElement.addEventListener('click', themeSwitch);
});

// check session storage on page load
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  var theme = sessionStorage.getItem('theme');
  if (theme) {
    var linkElement = document.querySelector('link[data-theme]');
    linkElement.href = './bootswatch/' + theme + '/bootstrap.min.css';
  }
});
```

In this code, the `themeSwitch` function replaces the `href` attribute of the `link[data-theme]` element with the respective `bootstrap.min.css` file from the `bootswatch` directory when an anchor with `data-switch` attribute is clicked. It also stores the current theme in the session storage. Upon page load, it checks the session storage for the current theme and replaces the `href` attribute of the `link[data-theme]` element with the respective `bootstrap.min.css` file from the `bootswatch` directory. This ensures that the selected theme persists across page reloads. Please replace `'./bootswatch/' + theme + '/bootstrap.min.css'` with the actual path to your `bootstrap.min.css` files if necessary.
